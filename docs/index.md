# Importance Sampling for Keras

Deep learning models spend countless GPU/CPU cycles on trivial, correctly
classified examples that do not individually affect the parameters. For
instance, even a very simple neural network achieves ~98% accuracy on MNIST
after a single epoch.

Importance sampling focuses the computation to informative/important samples
(by sampling mini-batches from a distribution other than uniform) thus
accelerating the convergence.

This library:

* wraps Keras models requiring just **one line changed** to try out *Importance Sampling*
* comes with modified Keras examples for quick and dirty comparison
* is the result of ongoing research which means that *your mileage may vary*

## Quick-start

The main API that is provided is that of
`importance_sampling.training.ImportanceTraining`. The library uses composition
to seamlessly wrap your Keras models and perform importance sampling behind the
scenes.

The example that follows is the minimal working example of importance
sampling. Note the use of a **separate final activation layer** in order for the
library to be able to get the pre-activation outputs.

```python
from keras.datasets import mnist
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Activation
import numpy as np

from importance_sampling.training import ImportanceTraining

# Load mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 784).astype(np.float32) / 255
y_train = np.eye(10).astype(np.float32)[y_train]
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 784).astype(np.float32) / 255
y_test = np.eye(10).astype(np.float32)[y_test]

# Build your NN normally
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu', input_shape=(784,)))
model.add(Dense(512, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(10))
model.add(Activation("softmax"))
model.compile("adam", "categorical_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])

# Train with importance sampling
history = ImportanceTraining(model).fit(
    x_train, y_train,
    batch_size=128, epochs=5,
    verbose=1,
    validation_data=(x_test, y_test)
)
```

## Installation

Importance sampling has the following dependencies:

* Keras >= 2
* numpy
* blinker

You can install it from PyPI with:

```bash
pip install --user keras-importance-sampling
```
